# PathFinding

Welcome to path visualizer.

## Algorithms

It supports the follwing algorithms:

**Dijkstra's Algorithm**: the father of path finding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path

**A-Star Algorithm**: arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm

## How to run

To run the file all you need is Java complier running on your device. Use any code editor of your choice i.e. VS Code, Netbeans etc.

1. Open a command prompt window and go to the directory where you saved the java program (PathFinding.java).

2. Type 'javac PathFinding.java' and press enter to compile your code.

3. Now, type 'java PathFinding' to run your program.
